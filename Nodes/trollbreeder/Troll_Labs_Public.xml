    <note>Gov Conspiracies
1. US Goverment wants a decypher program for DEC files. This invades privacy
2. Goverment wants Pointclicker to store every single ip that plays pointclicker on a server. Again, privacy invasion!
3. Goverment wants a Wazzapp backdoor to "fight against terrorism". AGAIN, PRIVACY INVASION
4. Snapple VS Appel. Who has the most privacy? Snapple. BECAUSE APPEL PUTS A BACKDOOR IN ITS "IMPROVED" EOS VERSIONS!
5. VPS' will dissapear due to stupid govs.
6. AHOY STEALS MEH DATA! And sells it to the gov. And other shitheads like Moodel (privacy stealers).
7. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion. Privacy invasion.
8. If all of this is correct, i can get into Ahoy, scan their net, snoop around the connected links and get into the gov.
9. GOVERMENT IF YOU ARE READING THIS, THEN GO FUCK YOURSELf! STOP STEALING MY PERSONAL DETAILS</note>
